### What I learned

Honestly, this project took me a while to do. I was not very strong in the area of CSS layouts and I feel like this project really challenged my abilities and made me a stronger frontend developer.
I definetely need to work on more projects involving CSS layout and design.

I really tried my best to use semantic HTML in this project and I need to improve on that further.

In this project, I used svg images for the first time and it was confusing working with it at first but i think i got the hang of it.
